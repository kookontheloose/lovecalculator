THINKING THROUGH THE PROGRAM------

randomNumber holds the the number we need to display 

it will run at the top of the page and hold its value until the page is run again

(i think it needs to be moved outside of the love calculator function)

calculate love score uses randomNumber but its main function is to return a paragraph based on what randomNumber is. 

we need to call it and display its VALUE when the button is pushed.

should we use addEventListener("click", thenCallAFunctionThatSwapsOutTheText())

this is how we grab the main text to swap it out. It needs to go in a function so we can grab it easily---------

document.querySelector("#main-text).
innerHTML="
    <h1>
        value of randomNumber?
    </h1>
    <p>
        value of calculateLoveScore?
    </p>"

(again - we need to move randomNumber outside of the main function so we can add a couple more functions to the index.js file that also use the randomNumber variable with it staying constant for each function use)


I think we need to either inject the number back into the javascript 

OR 

somehow capture each version of what we want to return (the number and the paragraphs) into divs with specific IDs and return those IDs 

either way we have to write JS into HTML somehow or write HTML into JS somehow.

we can glitter up the number just like we did the giant sparkle text
